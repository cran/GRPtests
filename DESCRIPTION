Description: Methodology for testing nonlinearity in the conditional mean function
    in low- or high-dimensional generalized linear models, and the significance of
    (potentially large) groups of predictors. Details on the algorithms can be
    found in the paper by Jankova, Shah, Buehlmann and Samworth (2019)
